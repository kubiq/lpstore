License of the SuggestInput:

The jQuery, jQuery.dimensions and jQuery.bgiframe have their own licenses

I mostly like BSD, but you can do everything you want with this 
library (except the above mentioned files) except of removing my name and the 
download link from the file (espacially you CAN use it free of charge in 
commercial applications)
